Oracle is set to make a significant impact in Morocco with the opening of new facilities aimed at enhancing the country's technology landscape. This move is part of a broader strategy to foster innovation and create job opportunities for local talent.

## Key Aspects of Oracle's Expansion

- **New R&D Center**: Oracle will establish a research and development center in Casablanca, focusing on cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This center is expected to create over 1,000 jobs for IT professionals.

- **Partnership with Government**: The expansion was formalized through an agreement between Oracle's CEO, Safra Catz, and Morocco's Minister for Digital Transition, Ghita Mezzour. This partnership signifies a commitment to advancing Morocco's digital economy.

- **Regional Job Creation**: About 40% of the new positions will be located outside major cities like Casablanca and Rabat, promoting economic growth in other regions such as Agadir and Northern Morocco.

- **Youth Empowerment**: The project aligns with King Mohammed VI's vision to empower Moroccan youth through technology. It emphasizes skill development in emerging fields like AI and big data.

- **Global Reach**: The innovations developed at the new center will not only serve Moroccan businesses but will also be utilized globally, positioning Morocco as a key player in the tech industry.

This expansion represents a pivotal step for both Oracle and Morocco, promising to drive technological advancement and create a vibrant job market in the tech sector.
